You wake up tired and groggy in the middle of a forest. You sleepily scan your surroundings and notice that they are unfamiliar and you have no idea how you got here. You try hard to remember how you got here, but you just can&apos;t seem to find the memory. In fact, you can&apos;t find any of your memoriesâ€¦

You snatch your backpack up off the ground, sling it over your shoulders, and start your quest to explore the island in hope of discovering who you are, how you got here, and how you&apos;re going to get home.

(hint - Press L to examine your surroundings again. Items, objects, or scenery may have magically appeared while you have been observing the room.)

(hint - Say &quot;talk to&quot; instead of asking)

Escape From Paradise
Can you find your way back home? by Nik Hager
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Camp
The camp is set up in a small clearing between four huge canopy trees for shade and shelter from rain. You notice there is a fire pit in the middle that you must have build before, but the fire has burnt out leaving a mound of ash surrounded by charred rocks.

You can see a tent, a knife, a coil of rope, and a bottle (empty) here.

Beach
You head south, weaving through the trees, watching the grassy terrain of the jungle slowly fade to dirt. Soon, the dirt is gone and you can see the ocean through the remainder of the trees. You burst through the gap out of  the foliage and into the light. The sand heats your toes and sends a warm surge throughout your body.

&quot;Hey!&quot; he replies. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen you here before. You must be looking for my dad. He&apos;s the Chief of our tribe. I guess that makes him the Chief of the island too &quot;cause we&apos;re the only tribe left. Ha! Anyways, he went up to the Mountain Shrine. He heard some people talking about a lost portion of the shrine that has been forgotten for hundreds of years so he went up there to look for it. You should go talk to him, just walk up the mountain north of the forest. It&apos;s not that far from here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; you reply.

&quot;No problem,&quot; says the Chief&apos;s son, &quot;Good luck finding him!&quot;

As you walk out of the hut you realize that the boy spoke in a foreign language you are sure you&apos;ve never heard before, but strangely it makes sense to you.

The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to rub the statues so I rubbed the statues and nothing happened. This stupid door hasn&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot;

Beach
You head south, weaving through the trees, watching the grassy terrain of the jungle slowly fade to dirt. Soon, the dirt is gone and you can see the ocean through the remainder of the trees. You burst through the gap out of  the foliage and into the light. The sand heats your toes and sends a warm surge throughout your body. The relaxing sun shines down onto the water, causing it to shimmer with brilliance.

The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to rub the statues so I rubbed the statues and nothing happened. This stupid door hasn&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot;

&quot;Mmmhmmmâ€¦ I seeâ€¦ Well, you need to find a way to get home dontand&apos;t you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren&apos;t just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us.

&quot;Why would you bring that thing here! It has been terrorizing my people for hundreds of years!&quot; he shouts, &quot;BEGONE DEMON!!!&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; you reply. &quot;He&apos;s not going to hurt anyone. He was thirsty and I helped him. He was only trying to get food to survive when he destroyed your crops.&quot;

&quot;I see. Well in that case, you have solved the greatest problem of my people. You shall be known for all time as the Bwana Wa Mnyama Kivuli, Master of the Shadow Beast. Your name shall be worshipped for centuries to come.

Now that you have proved yourself you must make your decision. Do you still wish to return home?&quot;

The Chief speaks to the Shaman in a language you cannot understand and the Shaman nods. The Shaman walks over and puts his hand on your forehead.

&quot;Kutuma mtu huyu ambayo amekuja. Tafadhali bwana Tryn basi hii kufanyika. Kwa nguvu imewekeza katika mimi na miungu ya nchi hii. Mimi jitihada kuaga kwako na kurudi kwako nyumbani, kwa mkono wangu kichawi.&quot;You close your eyes and say, &quot;I wish I was back home!&quot; he chants.

You feel a strong whipping wind swirl around you and the shadow fang backs away. You feel yourself lifting into the air and slowly losing consciousness before you black out completely.

When you shake off the dizziness and open your eyes, you are laying on your bed at home staring up at the ceiling. All your memories are coming back now. You remember that your name is James Palazo, you are 24 years old, you live in Boston Massachusetts, and seeing as the time is 4:00 PM, you&apos;re late for the Red Sox game!
