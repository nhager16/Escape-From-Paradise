You wake up tired and groggy in the middle of a forest. You sleepily scan your surroundings and notice that they are unfamiliar and you have no idea how you got here. You try hard to remember how you got here, but you just can&apos;t seem to find the memory. In fact, you can&apos;t find any of your memories…

You snatch your backpack up off the ground, sling it over your shoulders, and start your quest to explore the island in hope of discovering who you are, how you got here, and how you&apos;re going to get home.

Escape From Paradise
An Interactive Fiction by Nik Hager
Release 1 / Serial number 131007 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Camp
The camp is set up in a small clearing between four huge canopy trees for shade and shelter from rain. You notice there is a fire pit in the middle that you must have build before, but the fire has burnt out leaving a mound of ash surrounded by charred rocks.

You can see a knife, a coil of rope, and a bottle (empty) here.

Mountain Summit Shrine
You walk up the long winding mountain path until you reach the summit. There is a shrine here for one of the island&apos;s gods. A man in shiny golden robes and a silver helmet is examining a massive golden door guarded by two black statues. The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to press the tiles so I pressed the tiles. You haven&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot; The man hears your footsteps and turns around red and irritated.

&quot;I am Chief Radzen, leader of the Geracian tribe and this is my land. Who are you and what is your purpose for coming to me?&quot; he says.

You explain your situation to the Chief while he nods understandingly.

&quot;Mmmhmmm… I see… Well, you need to find a way to get home don&apos;t you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren&apos;t just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us. Hmmmm… there is a magical beast on the other side of the river to the east of our village. It has been terrorizing my people, eating our livestock and trampling our crops. Find the beast and kill him. Then come talk to me. I景漠牵挠牥浥湯慩&apos;ll be in my hut; thinking of ways to open that stupid door…re w&quot;


The Chief then walks briskly past you and dissapears down the mountain path.

You can see a golden door and a Chief here.

You head south, weaving through the trees, watching the grassy terrain of the jungle slowly fade to dirt. Soon, the dirt is gone and you can see the ocean through the remainder of the trees.

Mountain Summit Shrine
You walk up the long winding mountain path until you reach the summit. There is a shrine here for one of the island&apos;s gods. A man in shiny golden robes and a silver helmet is examining a massive golden door guarded by two black statues. The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to press the tiles so I pressed the tiles. You haven&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot;

You can see a golden door and a Chief here.

&quot;Mmmhmmm… I see… Well, you need to find a way to get home don&apos;t you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren&apos;t just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us. Hmmmm… there is a magical beast on the other side of the river to the east of our village. It has been terrorizing my people, eating our livestock and trampling our crops. Find the beast and kill him. Then come talk to me. I&apos;ll be in my hut; thinking of ways to open that stupid door…&quot;

Hidden Shrine Room
You walk in through the hidden entrance and burst into a shrine room for the island&apos;s main God. The room is amazing. Its gold, intricately engraved tiles on the floor and shimmering walls, giving off a faint flickering glow, made it hard to believe the room had been lost for centuries.

You can see a golden statue here.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to press the tiles so I pressed the tiles. You haven&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot;

Hidden Shrine Room
You walk in through the hidden entrance and burst into a shrine room for the island&apos;s main God. The room is amazing. Its gold, intricately engraved tiles on the floor and shimmering walls, giving off a faint flickering glow, made it hard to believe the room had been lost for centuries.

You can see a golden statue here.

Mountain Summit Shrine
You walk up the long winding mountain path until you reach the summit. There is a shrine here for one of the island&apos;s gods. A man in shiny golden robes and a silver helmet is examining a massive golden door guarded by two black statues. The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.

He is muttering to himself, &quot;Stupid door, why won&apos;t you open? The Shaman said to press the tiles so I pressed the tiles. You haven&apos;t been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can&apos;t get into the shrine room!&quot;

You can see a wall (on which are a brown tile, a yellow tile, a black tile, a white tile, a green tile, a red tile, and a blue tile) and a golden door here.

&quot;I am Chief Radzen, leader of the Geracian tribe and this is my land. Who are you and what is your purpose for coming to me?&quot; he says.

You explain your situation to the Chief while he nods understandingly.

&quot;Mmmhmmm… I see… Well, you need to find a way to get home dontand&apos;t you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren&apos;t just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us. Hmmmm… there is a magical beast on the other side of the river to the east of our village. It has been terrorizing my people, eating our livestock and trampling our crops. Find the beast and kill him. Then come talk to me. I￿￿&apos;ll be in my hut; thinking of ways to open that stupid door…re&quot;


The Chief then walks briskly past you and dissapears down the mountain path.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The man hears your footsteps and turns around red and irritated.

&quot;I am Chief Radzen, leader of the Geracian tribe and this is my land. Who are you and what is your purpose for coming to me?&quot; he says.

You explain your situation to the Chief while he nods understandingly.

&quot;Mmmhmmm… I see… Well, you need to find a way to get home don&apos;t you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren&apos;t just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us. Hmmmm… there is a magical beast on the other side of the river to the east of our village. It has been terrorizing my people, eating our livestock and trampling our crops. Find the beast and kill him. Then come talk to me. I&apos;ll be in my hut; thinking of ways to open that stupid door…&quot;


The Chief then walks briskly past you and dissapears down the mountain path.
