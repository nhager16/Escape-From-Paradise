    Problem C8ObjectIsValue issued from Chapter 8/Make Assertions.w, line 1284
    (Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the definition of the mountain summit shrine is "[if entering room for the first time] You walk up the long winding mountain path until you reach the summit. There is a shrine here for one of the island's gods. A man in shiny golden robes and a silver helmet is examining a massive golden door guarded by two black statues. The air coming from the door feels magical, almost like a divine being is on the other side.	He is muttering to himself, 'Stupid door, why won't you open? The Shaman said to press the tiles so I pressed the tiles. You haven't been opened for hundreds of years! How are we supposed to commence all of our ceremonial rituals if we can't get into the shrine room!' The man hears your footsteps and turns around red and irritated.	'I am Chief Radzen, leader of the Geracian tribe and this is my land. Who are you and what is your purpose for coming to me?' he says.	You explain your situation to the Chief while he nods understandingly.	'Mmmhmmm[unicode 8230] I see[unicode 8230] Well, you need to find a way to get home don't you? We could help you, but first you need to prove you are worthy of our assistance and that you aren't just someone from an enemy tribe trying to invade us. Hmmmm[unicode 8230] there is a magical beast on the other side of the river to the east of our village. It has been terrorizing my people, eating our livestock and trampling our crops. Find the beast and kill him. Then come talk to me. I'll be in my hut; thinking of ways to open that stupid door[unicode 8230]'	The Chief then walks briskly past you and dissapears down the mountain path.">.)

      >--> You wrote 'The definition of the Mountain Summit Shrine is "[if entering
        room for the first ti [...] dissapears down the mountain path."' (source
        text, line 355): but this seems to say that a thing is a value, like saying
        'the chair is 10'.
